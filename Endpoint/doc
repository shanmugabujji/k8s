Service is a gateway that distributes the incoming traffic between its endpoints
Endpoints contain the address of underlying Pods to which the service will route the traffic to.

Step 1 - Create Simple Service

Create a Simple Service in Kubernetes. This service will have its own IP.

service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
 name: simple-service
spec:
 ports:
 - port: 80
   targetPort: 80

# kubectl create -f service.yaml

# output
     # C:\kplabs-k8s>kubectl describe service simple-service


     # Name : simple-service
     # Namespace:default
     #Labels: <none>
     #Annotations: <none>
     #Selector: <none>
     #Type :ClusterIP
     #IP Family Policy:
     #IP Families: 
     #IP:
     #IPs:
     #Port:
     #TargetPort:
     #Endpoints: none
